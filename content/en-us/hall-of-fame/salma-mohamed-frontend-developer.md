> **The story:**

I will tell you about Salmi's story in programming..

I first introduce you to Salma, she is a gym trainer who has been in Port Said for seven years

Salma graduated from Computers and Information and after that she worked for some time in programming at Front End Company, and they were working on something called drupal, we don't have to..

\=============================

Salmi left work when the company closed and went to the gym. She wanted to come back with strength, and she was determined to come back with strength and take the chance again. She got tired and learned again from the first Javascript¬†[](<>). Her concern is anyone who says any words focused on herself

\=============================

Salmi entered the Interview a lot, considering 15 people, and she refused a lot, and she never stopped, and every time she says that I will improve my levels, and she takes this refusal in order to be better and the required tickets are more

Salami Jalha once two more

Peace be upon her, although she got more than two, and she will start after a while, she has not stopped anything and she is still studying

And get tired every day

I am really proud of Salma Mohamed.
