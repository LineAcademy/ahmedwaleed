I did an interview with Ahmed today ðŸ”¥

Despite the fact that I made a lot of interviews, and that I already do interviews with us in the company ðŸ˜…, I benefited very much from Ahmed. Literally, he grabbed everything in the CV and checked it.

But most importantly of all, he will not tell you about your faults in Interview, as Ahmed did

I was very happy with the interview, and I had to enter to tell you so that you can try it, and if you remember that it was just a chat, do not interfere ðŸ˜…
