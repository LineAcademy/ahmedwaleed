### Use Cloudinary

One of the most important things that will make you improve the performance of the web site is CloudNery, with your hands the comfort of downloading images, uploading them, or modifying them in any format, including the webp format, because this is one of the most important formats in which we upload all images in order to save space

```javascript
// nuxt.config.ts
image: {
    provider: 'cloudinary',
    cloudinary: {
      baseURL: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/drcfigqqr/image/upload/<your-id>/',
    },
 }
```

***It's really time to start transferring your images to use Nuxt Image.¬†This will greatly improve your performance and make your site more accessible to everyone.¬†Don't forget to run tests on your more image-heavy pages and run tests regularly as things can change over time.***
