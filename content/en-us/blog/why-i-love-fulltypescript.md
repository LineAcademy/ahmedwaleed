My first deal was on a large web site and application for one of the large real estate companies in Alexandria. The code was all nextjs / javascript. After several discussions, my job was to convert all the components to TypeScript, because we were building scale applications with new futures. Unfortunately, we encountered many problems, and part of them was javascript. And if we didn't take care of certain things, the important thing was that it was my first experience and I learned a lot because the web site was very big, and I also had Tim who was also responsible for converting part of the web site.
