I am very proud of these people. Since I ran a competition in my community, I entered teams in it and also from different levels so that they can benefit from each other and get used to the work of the team. Although it was the first time they worked in Team and Deadline, I found a masterpiece in the full sense of the word.

> **The people who won and the projects:**

T﻿he First is [Maha](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100034842552910&__cft__[0]=AZXTeCfUXRtZTBLyaGetfxAgcFenV2p5E2Gs3KEVqbIRbRVaEYctt9z5RqlzGH5J6PnlJuMMfNNKsjeo7KM6BhdlDNcFvXPh_ccsfyfjP4W7KfAPPMw_pDRHtmzCBoOLlAJwQlbaFKpaG-PABOrb9IPoO-yxYO6p18m-5QOX_A-pyo5CUQf4_xONrPfrAMoVDGQ&__tn__=-]K-R) :

Her friend who is in the team apologized, but she completed and did the project on her own, and also in Deadline, she is currently in vue, a solid one, I mean

\===========================================

The second team, Yousra Adel and Rahma (Because I do not have a mention):

[](<>)This team is really very nice people and they worked with each other the best job and got nice results although they met problems in assembling the project, but they faced it

\===========================================

Third Hosam Salah:

He didn't have anyone with him, so he said to do the project and in a short time alone

\===========================================

Fourth, Hagar Mhmd Salma Mohamed:

These two really worked hard on the project and did what they had to, and if it weren't for the fact that they just didn't have time to fix the last thing, they would have been the first people

\===========================================

Fifth @ Israa Mo ShalaSh :

These two were a little late, but because of their first meeting, but they did a great job, and had it not been for dividing the project, they would have been more great..

And they take the feedback and they will adjust their projects for the better and know their mistakes

\===========================================

Thank you to this beautiful Tim, and of course you are compensated for everyone who was unable to enter due to circumstances. There are many upcoming projects.

Thank you to those two who were with the team and helping them
