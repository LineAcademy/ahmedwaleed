> ***Note: This site is based on Nuxt :)***

I was researching a framework at a previous job and was having issues with server-side rendering because SPA was something no company or client would want. Vue was great, but it was not suitable for us, and from here I suggested to my managers to transfer the project to Nuxt, and I attended a lecture in which I would say what we will benefit from when we transfer the entire project to Nuxt, and also because the whole team knows Vue and was not familiar with the Nuxt framework, thank God The manager agreed and told me that I am responsible for transferring the project, and I am also responsible for two people with me in the team, that I let them learn Nuxt, and give them specific tasks so that we can work on the project together.

> **The difference between Vue and Nuxt in displaying web content**

For example: Here Vue, the entire application is displayed in one div called app, and the content is not displayed because it is Virtual Dom, and this is bad in terms of search tools, and for example, the google bot will not see content, so it will think that the web site is empty, which is bad...

And here, Nuxt displays all the content in the Dom, and we are about to solve the problem of exporting search tools, and this is called SSR.

###### Nuxt education

Nuxt is really easy to learn, so it took me a very short time to teach them and distribute the tasks, because they knew Vue and made it easy for any programmer, as if I wrote Html, Css books. The only thing is that I wasn't a Nuxt expert and all of a sudden I was leading a team and projects. I faced a lot of challenges but with the feedback, resources, and Nuxt community it was a bit easier.

###### Your pleasure with Nuxt

The project was large and included Ordering, Searching, SEO, BLOG and Hotel System

And﻿One of the things that must be done is that the site is fast in loading pages and is also suitable for search engines, because a large part of the project works only on searches, and that people are looking for specific places, and we must outperform our competitors in search.

I decided to use Nuxt, its content system with Markdown Files, and left all the data as MarkDown, including hotels and articles, and even the search was looking at the content written in markdown, and this was completely new to my team because it used to use Full-Stack and Real Time Load, but JamStack we write the content in Dashboard takes two minutes, rebuilds the site, and then uploads it to the server as a static site.

###### Doubts with JamStack

B﻿I asked a question like this, "Are you trying to tell me that if I change some content, the site should be re-created and published?" And my answer was, oh, it's normal. Two minutes. Of course, it would benefit from the fact that the site is fast in performance, because indeed all pages will be present and more secure, because there is no interaction with backend during browsing, and this was useful in the project that I was working on in particular, and this is what made me nominate Nuxt.

I'm not good at giving up and I didn't intend to lose this fight. I was convinced that Nuxt static website is the perfect case for agency website, travel agent website, hotel promotion websites. The funny thing is, the team fought the static because you had to rebuild the site and it didn't actually make any sense as the content only gets updated once every few weeks, even if that.

###### Nuxt awesome

If you want to build a JamStack, FullStack, or whatever technology, Nuxt is great. It's easy to learn and easy to teach people. I think anyone can easily learn it and build a website up and running without much dev experience like you can write pure Html, Css, JS and that's pretty cool. With Nuxt, you can have non-technical people like designers help out on a project because the code base is easy to understand.

###### M﻿Nuxt features

* SEO optimization for SPA
* It comes with the ability to create static websites out of the box
* Static sites, again, have great security
* Enterprise ready compared to Vue.js
* Automatic code splitting

###### Popular Nuxt

\
One of the reasons we delved deeper into Nuxt is how it has jumped in popularity over the past year.

If we look back a bit from 2021 to our JamStack.org survey, Nuxt.js wasn't even on the list of most popular frameworks. But fast-forwarding to this year, Nuxt is solidly "liked" at number nine on the list with a 64.15% "likeable" against a scary number.
