Website developers have two options, one is to build a static HTML website or build a website that interacts with a database to get the latest content and images. Both options have their pros and cons:

##### If you choose to develop an HTML website:

* Less hardware requirements and possibly your own website can be hosted directly on a CDN, which means your website load time will be low compared to a database based website. 
* Low cost because you don't need a large server
* Potentially a better page speed result
* Less maintenance
* Shorter development time
* It would be difficult to edit the content or images because the website owner must be able to write and understand HTML/CSS.
* Creating forms, for example, such as a contact us page to send data, will be a problem

##### If you choose a CMS based website, you should:

* You don't need to be a developer to edit the content.
* Greater hardware requirements since you have a database to interact with.
* Higher maintenance because you need to upgrade your CMS and plugins
* Security - This is a key point because most content management systems and frameworks follow a pattern that makes it relatively easy for a hacker to exploit a known vulnerability.
* High cost of maintenance 

A few smart companies including my company [Line-IT](https://lineitsolutions.com/en) realized that we could create an intersection of these two to provide a better solution for their customers. It was only 4﻿ years ago that the term "Jamstack" was described as the way to approach website development or publishing.

##### IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF JAMSTACK:

* A SSG like Gatsby / Hugo / Nuxt / Next
* GIT for CI/CD
* CMS - Preferably a headless CMS like Strapi but one can use their own existing CMS.
* CDN like Netlify or AWS Cloud Interface. We prefer netlify because it also helps with form submission and analytics.

##### **J for Javascript, A for APIs, M for Markup.** 

JavaScript handles the dynamic elements of the page and the user experience as well. APIs allow content experiences to be called by Javascript when needed. The markup is different for more modern websites which also feature different applications. Markup is short for HTML. Stack in Jamstack points out the various ways in which these technologies are combined to provide a great user experience for the end users. It is similar to Microsoft Stack and Lamp Stack as an example.

##### **Jamstack Benefits**

Jamstack offers many advantages since it is very popular in the industry. Let's know a few

* **Stability**  – While using an old HTML site, you must have noticed that it slows down sometimes. When you have to keep old apps, such a platform takes a lot of time. This is usually the case when the code is inherited from someone else. Jamstack has a core nature to the Jamstack approach in that static HTML is accessible to end users. Third party APIs are needed to direct dynamic features, but API downtime cannot cause any problems for your website when managed appropriately.
* **Speed**  ​​- With Jamstack, a combination of pre-rendered HTML and CDN is used which makes your website extremely fast. The similarity of Amazon, Google, and eBay has shown the effects of small incremental improvements in website speed on user engagement or on conversion. Page speed is a ranking factor for search queries. Thus, for good SEO, page speed is a key ranking factor. You'll have to take care that you don't bloat your website with external javascript that's too heavy and bulky. Jamstack will keep your website fast. Jamstack approach will improve your website speed.
* **Security**  - The component that helps runtime websites and database-driven applications, communication is necessary for the database and web server so that data is accessed to create the web page the user requests. Connectivity is referred to as a weak point when it comes to website security. But when it comes to the Jamstack website, it's static HTML. Server and database not required. Even a hacker might avoid DDOS attacks because he would need to put up with the power of a CDN and not a tiny little server.
* **Scalability**  - Competing with Jamstack's delivery mechanism is tough when it comes to scalability. Since the website is delivered through a CDN, the cost involved in scaling a Jamstack website or app from a  **[Web Development Company](https://lineitsolutions.com/en/services/web-development-company)**  is comparatively less. Since there are more moving parts in a database-driven website, it will be difficult to scale.[](https://lineitsolutions.com/en/services/web-development-company)
* **Serviceability**  - Serviceability refers to the degree to which the service of an item is performed. This is usually done with the help of certain resources and a specific period. The maker experience is a critical component to the continued success of your app or website. This group of people covers developers, designers, digital marketers, content editors, and anyone else involved in managing and creating digital experiences for users. 

Jamstack is gaining momentum and is being adopted by the developers. It is already operational and should be considered for upcoming projects. It can be very suitable if your website needs speed and security.

We work with the latest tools and technologies at our disposal to deliver solutions that best suit our clients' needs. We've been working with Jamstack for some time now and can ensure a rich user experience with high engagement in the apps we design and develop for our clients. Our process for development:

* Userflow and Wireframing
* User interface design
* Frontend development and CMS API integration

Our development center is located in Egypt and we work on a project basis or you can hire an experienced dedicated developer from my team.
